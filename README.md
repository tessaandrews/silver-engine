Weather Dashboard
This website displays the current, and five day forcast of a destination inputted in the search bar, or clicked on the list of cities.

When prompted to input a city, the current weather, and a visual will display in relation to the weather status.

The idea behind this project was to ensure users would be able to discover the weather in a different city, and be prompted with a visual and a five day forecast to ensure they dressed properly or knew what they were expecting.
